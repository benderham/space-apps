## How is Earth Feeling?
We decided that the real problem that needed to be solved was a language problem. How do you converting science language into every day language? What’s the one way that every human being on Earth, even babies (across all cultures) can communicate incredibly complex data? Facial expressions. 

If a picture can tell a thousand words, that’s millions of data points. So we thought how do you convert NASA data into face data? While being non-patronising and making people care. Is there already a solution that people use and understand? 

Our solution: a site (mobile and desktop) that gives real time updates on what data from around the world is saying about the changing conditions of our home. But the data is conveyed in a simple easy to understand language. Face Data in the form of Earth based emoticons. 

The site also generates saveable playlists based on the Earth’s current mood, using the metadata in tracks on Spotify and Spotify API. This helps with community engagement and adds some feeling to depressing situations. 

Using this data we hope that we can encourage visitors to the site to help us turn frowns upside down. Just showing the data isn’t enough. We leave visitors with a positive piece of information that they can implement, which will actually help the planet.​​
